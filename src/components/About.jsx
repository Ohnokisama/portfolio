          Hi! I'm Onuoha Jephthah, a passionate Web Developer and UI/UX Designer with a knack for creating intuitive, user-centered digital experiences. With a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for design, I blend creativity and technical expertise to craft websites and applications that not only look great but also function seamlessly. <br /><br />

          I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and performance-optimized websites using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. As a UI/UX designer, I focus on understanding user behavior to create designs that solve real problems and enhance the overall user journey. <br /><br />

          When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring the latest design trends, experimenting with new web frameworks, or working on side projects to sharpen my skills. <br /><br />

          Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
